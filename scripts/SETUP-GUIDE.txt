Follow these steps to populate your Supabase database with workout data:

STEP 1: Add Your Data
----------------------
1. Open: scripts/workout-data.ts
2. Replace level1Data array with your Level 1 JSON (from previous message)
3. Replace level2Data array with your Level 2 JSON (from previous message)

STEP 2: Run the Script
-----------------------
In your terminal, run:
  bun run scripts/populate-workouts.ts

WHAT IT DOES
------------
✓ Extracts unique exercises from your data
✓ Populates the 'exercises' table
✓ Creates workouts grouped by week/day
✓ Links exercises to workouts with sets/reps/rest

The script uses upsert, so it's safe to run multiple times!
